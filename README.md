# 🖱️ Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention  🛒

Online shoppers purchasing intention dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330
sessions. The dataset is formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period
to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. More than 84% online
sessions did not result in users completing the purchase and consequently did not generate any sort of
revenue for the e-commerce website. This is a very serious issue which can affect the company’s market
share in future in a negative way.
